# Create Thumbnails for Lychee
Lychee plugin that recreates all the thumbnails if you accidentally deleted them (like I did).

# Installation
Simply download the index.php file and put it in your_lychee_root/plugins/create-thumbnails/index.php

# How to Use
1) Clear your thumbails folder (if you haven't done this already :) located at your_lychee_root/uploads/thumb/
2) Login to your lychee website
3) Go to http://your_lychee_url/plugins/create-thumbnails/index.php
4) Wait until it is done!
